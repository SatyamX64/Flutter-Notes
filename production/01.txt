First of add git to the repo and make first commit : "init Project"

Each commit message of format : [FILE_NAME] {add/fix/update/remove/prepare/refactor or any verb} {what did we change (2-5 words)}

Each commit should be stable and well documented. No quick-fix or temporary commits.
i.e Anyone else should be able to continue the Project from any previous commit if the need arises

Commit after every small change like :
    1. added new resources 
    2. created a new folder, with all the Structure files and placeholders
    3. Updated the placeholders file
