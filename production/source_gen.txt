"*.g.dart" is convention of naming generated files, with * being the file name

"$_" infront of class is just a convention
it means that it is a generated class.

So there are certain things that we need from a class :
    serialization    // we can use json_serializer for this
    toString()
    hashcode         // we can use equatable for this
    value type (i.e object with equal values are equal)    // we can use equatable for this or override == manually

Since we need this almost for all classes and it requires a lot of boiler plate, we generate this code
by using our generator class and defing all rules there.

source_gen basically means source code generation, and it is the base of packages like json_serializer or built_value

To generate source code : 
    add build_runner dev dependency
    add some_code_generator
    define a generator class
    pub run build_runner watch/read      (read is one-time, watch continuously generates code on change in generator)
