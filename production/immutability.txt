immutable means we cannot change a class after it has been instantiated

eg : 
    class Person {
        String name;
        String id;

        Person(this,name, this.id);
    }

    var monitor = Person('Rohan', 23);

    So, now monitor is Rohan whose id is 23
    Suppose Rohan tenure end and we need a new monitor. 
    For this we won't change Rohan's name to Sumit and his id to 24
    We will simply make a new Person('Sumit', 24) and assign him as monitor

    So all in all, monitor.name = 'xyz' is not allowed
    we have to do monitor = Person('Sumit',24)


add annotation @immutable over class to make it immutable in dart
// all members of immutable class are final as a result, since they won't change after init
