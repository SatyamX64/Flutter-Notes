make a new folder with the screen name in the screens folder

add file sc_screen_name.dart
    Scaffold 
        ListView(
            children : [
                components(), 
                components(),
                components(),
                components(),
            ]
        )

add file widget_component.dart in the same directory

add barrel_screen_name.dart in the samr directory
it exports all the widgets_file that are in the same folder
this saves us the extra verbose code during imports in the sc_screen_name

git commit -m "[SCREEN_NAME] add screen_name basic structure"

then update the components one by one and make commit each time
