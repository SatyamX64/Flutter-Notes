Flutter has 3 Layers : 
    framework   (written in dart) :       
        -> We interact with this and write almost all our code here
   
    engine  (written in C/C++) :
        -> isolates, runtime settings, platform channels etc 
    
    embedder (written in C/C++/Java/Objective C depending on platform) : 
        -> get entrypoint from OS, start flutter engine and directly talk with OS




Flutter has 3 Trees : 
    Widget Tree 
    Element Tree    
    Render Tree


Each widget is an Element 
    We have 2 classes deriving from Element 
        RenderObjectElement
        ComponentElement 

    Widgets that are actually printed on screen are derived from RenderObjectElement (eg : DecoratedBox, Text, Image etc)
    Widgets that hold other widgets are derived from ComponentElement (eg : Stack, Container, Column etc)


    Once we write our widget tree, and build the app , all the 3 trees are created 

       Widget Tree              Element Tree                              Render Tree

        Container               ComponentElement                        RenderDecoratedBox
            |                           |                                      |
        DecoratedBox            RenderObjectElement                     RenderParagraph
            |                           |                        
        SomeText                ComponentElement                        
            |                           |                         
        RichText                RenderObjectElement               

    // Only when new RenderObjectElement comes in the Element tree, the render tree is recreated 
       Usually we aim to reduce receating the render tree, we update values most of  the time
