Available only for mobile and desktop, method channels allow Dart to call platform-specific code
of your hosting app. Data are serialized from Dart and then deserialized in Java, Kotlin, Swift
or Objective-C.

eg:
    const channel = MethodChannel("person");
    final name = await channel.invokeMethod<String>("getPersonName");
    print(name); // 'name' is a regular Dart string
