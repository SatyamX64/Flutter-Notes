Dart is a client-optimized, garbage-collected, OOP language 

AOT - Ahead of Time Compiled
// i.e High Level Language like dart get compiled into native binary (like .apk,.exe,.ipa etc)
// So it becomes portable and doesn't need a dart VM to run
// Flutter gives us this AOT support for Dart

AOT compilation is very powerful because it natively brings Dart to mobile desktop. You’ll
end up having a single native binary which doesn’t require a DVM to be installed on the
client in order to run the application.


## So app is in 2 States 
1. During developement  
    JIT (Just in Time) + Dart VM
    This is a sort of dynamic compilation, and this runs during developement
    This allows the dispatch of the code dynamically without considering the user’s machine architecture. (beacuse it runs in VM)

    For Web : dartdevc

2. During Release
    This is where we use the AOT+runtime
    App get compiled into a native binary, that can be distributed

    For Web : dart2js

• The true power of Flutter lies on the fact that apps are built with their own rendering stuff and
they are not constrained to paint the UI following the rules "imposed" by OEM widgets. You’re
free to control the screen and manipulate every single pixel.

So App doesn't paint itself acc. to OEM components, but uses a custom Engine (Skia) to render everything
This allows us true freedom, to control every pixel on screen
Other Functionalities like Camera, Bluetooth, Audio, Sensors etc are directly accessed using Native code
As the required dart code is converted into Native, when we Release App

• A minimal Flutter app is about 4.4 MB on Android and 10.9 MB on iOS (depending on
the architecture, whether it be ARM 32 or 64 bit)


## To build app

$ flutter build appbundle
$ flutter build ios
$ flutter build web
$ flutter build macos
$ flutter build windows
$ flutter build linux
