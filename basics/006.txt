// What is Flutter ? 


Flutter is a tool that allows us to builf Native-cross-platform app with one codebase
Flutter : SDK + Framework
SDK - Compiles code into Native and also take cares of other technical details
Framework - It consists of UI Building Blocks, Widgets options, Pacakges, Functions etc.



                          ------------------  Flutter Framework
                         |                           | (based on)
                         |                         Dart {Programming Language}
                         |
Flutter -----------------|
                         |
                         |
                          ------------------ Flutter SDK (set of tools to Compile and other stuff)

Widgets : These are like code snippets that have a certain defined use
          eg: A snippet of code to render a button
          // More snippets can be based on that, like RaisedButton, FLatbutton etc.
        i.e Widgets is an immutable description of part of a user Interface

* One Important point to note is that although Flutter Compiles to native code, 
  it doesn't means that it just simply convert all components into native equivalent

  eg: In Android implementation  say androidButton() is the RaisedButton
      In Swift implementation say iosButton() is the RaisedButton

      Then Flutter won't convert the code of RaisedButton into androidButton or iosButton
      rather it will do a custom implementation irrespective of platform, as all screen pixels are controlled by Flutter

# Create Project using CLI
1. Go to the desired directory
2. flutter create project_name {has to be single word}
3. cd project_name
4. flutter run


#Files and their Uses

> .idea - configuration files for Android Studio
> .vscode - configuration files for vscode
> android - complete android project which will run of android devices {kind of like a seprate app in itself}
> ios - complete ios project
> build - output of flutter application is stored here (output is based on the above 2 folders)
> lib - contains the source code
> test - allows to run automated tests
> .gitignore - to place things not to be tracked by git
> .metadata - flutter stores some info here
> .project_name.iml , .pubspec.lock, .packages -- auto generated, stores some info, not important for user
> pubspec.yaml - to add project files and packages

#Whenever you tap on a textfield, flutter makes the screen shift up by the textfield height
 This ensures, that textfield is always visible

#PrimaryColor : only changes the PrimaryColor of app
 PrimarySwatch : makes all the shades in app based on this colors

#To take care of platform specific themes, use adaptive Widgets
 eg: switch.adaptive()   // will style automatically acc. to platform

#Repaint Rainbow : It is a devTool, it shows what all things are repainted after a particular event, like a buttonTap
--btw, repainted is not same as recreated
  repainted means Flutter try to use code from earlier/memory, so not vey resource intensive
  -- like appBar won't be rebuild in every frame, it is just repainted again and again
  rebuild is like created from scratch, rarely happens only if big changes occur
  -- if we come from a page that didn't have a appBar to a page that does have one, 
     then during first frame appBar will be rebuild
