#Running Native Code

So suppose you need the camera
Then ideally you will write some java/swift code to open that for you
Then you will intergrate that code into your Flutter codebase

Now everyone does not know that language so someone did the heavy part for you 
Now since its integrated you just call the functions you need, without worrying about the implementation
That are packages in general
