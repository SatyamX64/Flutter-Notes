// Interface 


When a class implements another class

Eg: 

class Employee {

    int name;
    int age;
    int salary;

    void foo(){

    }
}

Now lets say a class Manaager implements it

class Manager implements Employee {

   // Now I will have to implement all that was defined in Employee here as well 
   // super functions are not available here since this is not inheritance technically
   // Its just a contract that defines some rules I must fulfill
}
