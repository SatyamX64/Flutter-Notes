Saving files to local
-------------------------------

You have a file
use file.copy(path)
path is now where that thing will be stored
Both Android and IOS don't like you writing/reading stuff anywhere for security and privacy reasons
So they just give every app some space where it can play
This also helps when you unistall the app, the OS simply clears that space and all the data is gone
now to get access to that path, you need a package called path_provider
it provides us with a bunch of options :
 1. applicationDocumentsDirectory -- space given by OS to play
    applicationSupportDirectory -- blabla blabla
 2. externalStorage -- android specific, gives access to SD card 
 3. temporaryStorage -- this dir is regulary cleaned by OS, so use it only for small time
    // imagePicker stores the image in temp dir

each file.path gives us --> the route to where it's stored/file_name.extension
and that's what we have to provide during save as well 


import 'package:sqflite/sqflite.dart' as sql;
import 'package:sqflite/sqlite_api.dart';
import 'package:path/path.dart' as path;
class DBHelper {
  static Future<void> insert(String table, Map<String,Object> data) async{
    final dbPath = await sql.getDatabasesPath();
    final sqlDb = await sql.openDatabase(path.join(dbPath,'places.db'),onCreate: (db,version){
      return db.execute('write command here');
    },version: 1);
    await sqlDb.insert(table, data,conflictAlgorithm: sql.ConflictAlgorithm.replace) ;
  }
}
