# User Authentication and Token

Now ofcourse, we don't want just anyone to come and change anything in database
We want only users with access to change stuff

So how do we know someone is logged In or not
We use tokens

i.e with every request to server {i.e API} we have to attach a token 
we recieve the token as soon as we provide the server proper auth credentials
The server then generates a token using a private key {available only to server} and sends it back
That token then is saved in local and used for all subsequent API calls
