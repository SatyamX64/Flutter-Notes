# How to setup firebase as a generic database

1. Register app on firebase
2. Add Firebase to FLutter Project
3. Go to Realtime DataBase in test mode
   Here you will get the backend-url mentioned earlier

4. Now we can send request to firebase-url/table_name.json
   If we send post request our json will be added to that table_name
   table_name here is more of a hash-map kind of thing
   It stores all the values with a proper server-generated key
   As a response to the post request we get that key 

5. get
   Make a get request to the url/table_name.json to get all the data in a json

6. patch : to update the data
   Make a patch request to url/table_name/id.json
   http.patch(url,body : {new json})

7. delete : to delete the data
   Make a delete request to url/table_name/id.json
   http.delete(url)


# Optimistic Updating
-------------------------
We send the request for change to server and rather than waiting for it
We update locally, if no error found Good
if error do comes we revert back the local changes
