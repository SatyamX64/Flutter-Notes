# One cool thing while creating an app

1. First decide everything to be on the whiteBoard (literally everything)
2. Make a new Flutter Project and create a folder called screens
3. Make all the screens file
4. Make lean UI for all the screens assuming you have the data inside of widget
5. Make a models folder and add the Models you have in the project 
6. Then make the Provider folder and add Provider to manage your models
